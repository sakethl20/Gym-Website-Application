# Gym-Website-Application
A website created from scratch with the Django framework as well as the Python, HTML, and CSS languages. Includes different views for administrators vs. customers and a different login for each.

How to run the Django app:

1. Change file directory into the folder that has the virtual_env file.
2. Run the command: source virtual_env/bin/activate
3. Change file directory into the project file(ex:bakeryGoods)
4. This file should have the manage.py file. Run the command: python3 manage.py runserver
5. A web browser should open up. The website will not work until the url is changed. After the numbers given in the url, add the following: /bakery_home/home
6.This will take the user to the home page where login is required.
